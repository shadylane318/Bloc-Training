Hey Mark,

I'm going to describe to you some of my ideas of how to change our education system. I will be breaking everything down into categories and lists.

### Before we begin...
**Mission:** Change the way that people learn and obtain information by utilizing the best tools at our disposal today. Our goal is to leave behind old ways of teaching that is negatively affecting our society. Together we can accelerate the growth and innovation in all lines of work so that one day we can successfully become multi-planet species :rocket: :alien:. As Carl Sagan once said:

>_**Extinction is the rule and survival is the exception.**_
>   -Carl Sagan

### Three steps to designing a different system 
1. Redesign the architecture of the school
 - Circular design of the school will increase communication and productivity of it's staff and students.
 - It's already been done [ in Japan!] (https://www.ted.com/talks/takaharu_tezuka_the_best_kindergarten_you_ve_ever_seen?language=en)

2. Solar Powered Schools?
  - We know that schools are central to the communities that surround them. We also know that parents make decisions of where to live based on the schools available to them. What if the school can do more than provide an education to it's students? What if the school can provide something to the parents, or businesses in the area?
  - The schools can be fitted with solar panels and store the energy in something like this:

  - The energy would then be sold to the government, or state, in return for tax credits. This can provide the school the ability to provide a healthy income to it's staff. 

3. Change the way we teach.
  - Get rid of standardized testing. 
  - Create incredible software that understands an individual student's strengths and weaknesses
  - Allow more curiosity! Curiosity is very important to any learning experience.
  - Teach how to work from first principles. This is super important because people need to learn how to solve problems. As Matt Damon said in The Martian:

> _**At some point, everything's gonna go south on you and you're going to say, this is it. This is how I end. Now you can either accept that, or you can get to work. That's all it is. You just begin. You do the math. You solve one problem and you solve the next one, and then the next. And If you solve enough problems, you get to come home.**_

That's it! One day a more refined version of this idea will come to fruition. It has to.

P.S. One more thing! Example of code in message
````
// First program example

#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

int main (int argc, const char * argv[])
{
NSAutoreleasePool *pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];
NSLog (@"Hello, World!");
[pool drain];
return 0;
}
